# Object-Oriented Data Management Inventory System

This project is designed to strengthen skills in managing advanced data structures using JavaScript. The solution implements **Objects**, **Sets**, and **Maps** to design, manipulate, and validate product data while applying best coding practices and efficient iteration methods.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Manage products with unique identifiers, names, prices, and categories.
- Prevent duplicate product entries using `Set`.
- Store and associate additional product information using `Map`.
- Validate and iterate over product data using:
  - `for...in` for object properties.
  - `for...of` for Sets.
  - `Map.forEach()` for descriptive category listings.
- Responsive and intuitive user interface built with HTML5 and CSS3.
- Fast and efficient development workflow using Vite.
